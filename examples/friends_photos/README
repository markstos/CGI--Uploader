PREREQUISIITES

The following additional modules (plus their own dependencies) are
required for this example application:

CGI::Application
HTML::Template
CGI::Application::ValidateRM
SQL::Abstract

INSTALLATION

In photos.cgi, you need configure your DBI connection parameters,
and possibly adjust the 'use lib' line so that it can find
CGI::UPloader.

CLEAN UP

Once you are done playing with the application, you may wish to clean up
the database. Assuming you've used these resources only for this
example, you can clean up easily:

 - delete all the images in the 'uploads' sub-directory.
 - delete all the rows from address_book() and uploads() tables.
